## General Info

Minimalist website to experiment a blog page. I have a seperate JSON file where all the related information about the blog posts are coming from. Since the content is not important for this specific example, I have used the file to generate blog posts. User can choose to read among the posts and have a chance to comment on respective post. The amount of the comments that specific post has, is also available on the main page even before jumping to respective post page.

This website was particularly enjoyable to create since I have learnt a lot on the way. I have mastered Redux and simply got myself familiar with the basic structure of a blog page. Therefore, I am utterluy satisfied with the result. Hopefully, you enjoy too!
